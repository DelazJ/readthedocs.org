How to manage Read the Docs teams
=================================

Adding a user to a team
-----------------------

Adding a user to a team gives them all the permissions available to that team,
whether it's *read-only* or *admin*.
This can be done by:

* Navigating to :guilabel:`<Username dropdown>` > :guilabel:`Organizations` > :guilabel:`<Username name>` > :guilabel:`Teams` > :guilabel:`<Team name>`
* Clicking :guilabel:`Invite Member`.
* Input the user's Read the Docs username or email address.
* Clicking :guilabel:`Add member`.

Removing a user from a team
----------------------------

Removing a user to a team removes all permissions that team gave them

* Navigating to :guilabel:`<Username dropdown>` > :guilabel:`Organizations` > :guilabel:`<Username name>` > :guilabel:`Teams` > :guilabel:`<Team name>`
* Clicking :guilabel:`Remove` next to the user.


Grant access to users to import a project
-----------------------------------------

Make the user a member of any team with *admin* permissions,
they will be granted access to import a project.
